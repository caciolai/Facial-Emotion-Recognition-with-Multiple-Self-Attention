# Facial Emotion Recognition with Multiple Self Attention

This project implements a **multiple-self attention** mechanism to learn and combine fine-grained discriminative features in facial expressions for *Facial Emotion Recognition* (**FER**).

### Implementation

[Here](notebooks/training.ipynb) is a copy of the Colab notebook in which I implemented my model and carried out its training.

### Report

[Here](reports/report.pdf) is the report with the documentation of my model and the results it attains.
